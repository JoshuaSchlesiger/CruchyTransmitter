# CrunchyTransmitter 
Welcome to me the CrunchyTransmitter

## Why do I exist?!?
I came about because my mom Crunchyroll simply had no means of notification when one of her children was born (episodes released). My creator, the MilschSchnitte, always wanted to watch the latest episodes in the evening and be notified when one came out. Also, mom's website takes so long to load because of this stupid JavaScript.... 

Use me if you would like to receive notifications about your subscribed anime and also like to watch in advance when an episode will be released

## Support

For support please write me on Discord (milschschnitte).

I welcome any constructive suggestions for the project and will be happy to develop it further on request. In case of security problems or bugs please create an issue. The same applies to the app.

Since I privately pay for the server costs and the publishing on Google, I would be happy about a little support.
